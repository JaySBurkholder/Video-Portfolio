    <section id="About-Me">
        <h2> About Me </h2>
        <p>Born in Charlotte, NC, I grew up in a big city surrounded by family and friends.
            As I grew up, my interest in the cultural arts grew. 
            I began schooling in acting from an early age when my mother sent my brother and I to summer theatre camps. 
            This evolved into drama classes, then attendance at an arts high school, an NC Governer's School West session, 
            and finally attending the University of North Carolina at Greensboro for a B.A. in theatre. 
            During my late teen years, however, I was discovering that my interest in theatre stemmed largely from film. 
            Shortly after moving to the Triad area, my twin brother and I entered as a team into the Greensboro 48 Film Project.
            It was here that I discovered my love for film and furthered my drive to create art through an ensemble.  
            After a semester at UNCG for theatre, I dropped out. Taking time off from school allowed me to discover passions, explore adulthood,
            and focus on future career skills and motivations. In 2018, I came back to school to pursue a B.A. in Media Studies.
        
            Since then, I have taken on numerous film and televised projects, completed 7+ Greensboro 48 Hour Film Projects, 
            filmed various sporting events including collegiate sports, and even learned some front end web development on the side. 
            I take on clients big and small, with the aim to create content that not only satisfies but impresses audiences. 
            In my spare time, I create short films and YouTube videos with my small group of dedicated actors and friends under the guise of Be Kind Films. 

            I am a firm believer in human rights for all. In the past, I have been an activist and avid supporter for LGBTQ+ rights.
            As a visibly tattooed professional and gender non-conforming artist, I believe that self-expression is central to the quality and nature of the work I do. 
            Finally, as a multimedia project specialist, I know that putting my creative touch on a piece of work will always lead to more satisfying
            and fulfilling end results. The rest, is hard work. And that's the easy part.

        <p>We need to future-proof this win-win-win. 
    
            Great plan! Let me diarize this, and we can synchronize ourselves at a later timeframe, for strategic staircase wiggle room. 
            Idea shower: what's our go to market strategy? Table the discussion; 
            I just wanted to give you a heads-up, and run it up the flag pole for a performance review. 
            
            It's a simple lift and shift job. Throughput criticality, pre-think our game-plan. 
            So if you could do that, that would be great for critical mass. 
            Pull in ten extra bodies to help roll the tortoise, a loss a day will keep you focused, then loop back. 
            Back-end of third quarter, meeting assassins get buy-in to close the loop. When does this sun set?
